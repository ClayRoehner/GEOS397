## Lecture #4: Hillslope evolution
(Guest lecture by Mike Poulos)

### 1) Update the [master](https://github.com/dylanmikesell/GEOS397) branch on github.com. We are working Lecture/L05/[README.md].

### 1) Discussion of "Surface Dating of Dynamic Landforms: Young Boulders on Aging Moraines"

Key points:

* The dating of landforms is crucial to understanding the evolution, history, and stability oflandscapes.
* Scientists must take into account the dynamic nature of landforms and of the ever-present processes of erosion, deposition, and weathering.
